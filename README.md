## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.
- **Mybatis**: For database interactions and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **MySQL**: For database storage.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for high-speed caching of data, enabling fast access and reducing database load.
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code with annotations like `@Data`, `@Getter`, and `@Setter.
- **Sentinel**: For flow control and service governance.It to safeguard critical services, manage traffic spikes, and enhance fault tolerance.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for CRUD operations and banking transactions.
- **Kafka**: Distributed messaging system for asynchronous communication, decoupled services, and reliable real-time data streaming.
- **Quartz**: Distributed job scheduling framework used for executing tasks on a schedule (e.g., report generation, data cleanup, periodic synchronization).
- **Redission**: Redis client that provides distributed locks, distributed collections, and other concurrency utilities.
