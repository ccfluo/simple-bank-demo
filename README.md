## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.
- **Mybatis**: For database interactions and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **MySQL**: For database storage.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for high-speed caching of data, enabling fast access and reducing database load.
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code with annotations like `@Data`, `@Getter`, and `@Setter.
- **Sentinel**: For flow control and service governance.It to safeguard critical services, manage traffic spikes, and enhance fault tolerance.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for CRUD operations and banking transactions.
